    <h2>16.0 Adding Javascript to websites</h2>

    <p>We can have Inline, External, and Internal javascript :</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Inline :</p>
    <p>We can do &lt;body <span class="blue">onload="alert('HI');"</span>&gt; to have this script run 
    when the body element is loaded up.</p>
    <p>This inline javascript is not very modular and bad pratice, try to avoid building like this.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Internal :</p>
    <p>Can add it by adding in a script tag <span class="blue">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; CodeHere &lt;/script&gt;</span>.</p> 
    <script type="text/javascript">
        alert("internal script ran");
    </script>
    <br/>

    <p>External :</p>
    <p>Finally we can impliment javascript from an external file <span class="blue">&lt;script src="jsFileName"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.</span>
    Normally located in the body element (at the bottom of the body) so it does not try to change an element which does not yet exist.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Ex: if the javascript had (document,querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Good bye"), this should run after the HTML elements have complied so it doesnt 
        end up just finding nothing.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>16.1 Intro To the DOM</h2>

    <p>Adding functionality to HTML elements : The DOM catalogues the webpage into individual objects that we can select and manipulate.
       The catalogue is just a tree which should be equally represented if your HTML in indented correctly.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Below is a checkbox and button with added javascript functionality</p>
    <br/>
    <input type="checkbox">
    <button style=" color: red;">some button</button>

    
    <p><br/> How we did it : Basic path finding <br/>
    We know that the highest level for the HTML is document. We can use the doucment to navigate down the path to the exact part
    of the HTML code we want to add fucntionality. </p>
    <br/>
    <ui>
        <li>document; : is the document object</li>
        <li>.firstElementChild; : retruns everything in first child (documents first (and only) child is HTML)</li>
        <li>.firstElementChild.firstElementChild : Gets the first child of HMTL (head in our case)</li>
        <li>.firstElementChild.lastElementChild : Gets the last child of HMTL (body in our case)</li>
        <li>var head = document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.fristElementChild : Gets the first tag in the body of our HTML, which we can edit
            now by using javascript.
        </li>
        <li> head.innerHTML ="Good Bye": Will now change the text in h1</li>
        <li> head.style.color ="red": Will now change the color of h1</li>
    </ui>

    <p><br/> How we did it : Specific path finding <br/>
    To find the check box and the button we did path finding and editing by : </p>
    <br/>
    <ui>
        <li>document.querySelector("input").click(); : Look insdie document for object that has selector of "input", then call a method click on it (This method will simulate a click)</li>
    </ui>

    <h2>16.2 Selecting HTML Elements With javascript</h2>

    <p>Look at better ways to find the element your looking to modify/add functionality to.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Again we have our box and checkbox:</p>
    <input type="checkbox">
    <button class="btn1" style=" color: blue;">some button</button>
    <br/>

    <p><br/> Get elements by tag name : <br/>
    document.getElementsByTagName("Something"), will return array of items with that tag.
    To affect items in this iwe need to index it.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Get elements by class name :<br/>
    document.getElementsByClassName("Something"), will return array of items with that class.
    To affect items in this we need to index it.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Get element by ID : <br/>
    document.getElementById("Something"), will return a variable of the item with that ID, since IDs are unique.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>More about .querySelector() :</p>
    <p>The thing about document.querySelector() is that we can have it look for element, class, ID, etc but we need to specify its type
        just as when we set them up in the css file (# for ID), (. for class). 
    </p> <br/>

    <p>.querySelector() is even able to combine selectors to get what it needs. For example say in a list element we want to select the a tag.
        Then we do document.querySelector("li a"); and we get that. Can also combine types of selectors, say we want li with class item
        we get document.querySelector(li.item) (no spaces when the stuff occurs in the same element).
    </p> <br/>

    <p>If more than one item ends up satisfying the condition we only get back the first occuring item. To get all
       you'd need to use .querySelectorAll()
    </p>

    <h2>16.3 Maniplating and Changing Styles of HTML Elements with Javascript</h2>

    <p>How to use Javascript to manipulate the elements we've selected</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Again the button and checkbox</p>
    <br/>
    <input type="checkbox">
    <button class="btn2">some button</button>
    <br/>
    <p><br/> Changes to button done in .js file.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>16.4 Seperation of concerns</h2>

    <p>Rememeber : HTML is for content, CSS is for style, javascript is for behavior (so we wouldnt normally style the button in 16.3 in javascript)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>So to make style changes without directly writing them in JS we can use .classList <br/>
    document.querySelector("button").classList; gets all the classes on button <br/> 
    document.querySelector("button").classList.add("") , will add a class to the item. We can add a premade class to it, which by  heiarchy by being read last will overide the class before
    making the changes we want. <br/>
    There is also a .remove() as well.<br/>
    Also have .toggle(), if the class is there remove if if its not add it </p>
    <br/>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>16.5 Text Manipulation and the Text Content Property</h2>

    <p>.textContent : Lets us change the text content at the line without affect the inner HTML possibly around it
    So to also change style just user .innerHTML</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>16.6 Manipulating HTML Element Attributes</h2>

    <p>Reacll what an attribute is : things colored orange (class, type, href, src, etc) :</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Say we have a link that we want to change, lets get a list of attributes attached to the element. <br/>
    document.querySelector("a").attributes; : Will return a list of all the attributes attached to a. <br/>
    document.querySelector("a").getAttribute("href"); , To get the text the attribute is pointing at. <br/>
    document.querySelector("a").setAttribute("href", "ChangeTextTo"); , To set the text the attribute is pointing at. </p>
