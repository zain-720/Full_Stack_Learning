    <h2>36.0 : Intro </h2>
    <p>React learning files will be on (CodeSandbox) and (my-react-app once you learn how to use React better)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To make things easier, most work done will be complied in the my-react-app and built up to mordern standards to make
    understanding better.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To set up React in VS : Going to be using vite to build our apps, so do <br/>
        npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react, then <br/>
        Select as React as the framework, then <br/>
        Select Javascript as the variant to work with, then <br/>
        cd my-react-app, to go to the app build, then <br/>
        npm install, install dependencies, then <br/>
        npm run dev, to run server <br/>
        Vite will recomplie the server everytime its updated to make coding easier.</p>

    <h2>36.1 : Intro to JSX and Babel </h2>
    <br/>

    Notes : 
    <p><br/>
        <ui>
            <li>A single div in our body section with the ID root will be in most any React app
                by convention, and is the root of our react application. So everything we create
                in React will be inserted inside div ID root. This will be all the HTML code needed as the 
                rest will be done in the java-script file using React. </li>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 002648.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="370" height="200" />
            <p><br/></p>

            <li>In index.js the first thing we do is require the react and react-dom modules.</li>
            <p><br/></p>

            <li>Next <span class="blue">ReactDOM.render is depreciated</span> so we here we will use ReactDOM.createRoot, which
                does the same thing. Now we create a const "root" which has where we want to show the code, 
                while render() still holds what to show. So this, </li>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 011032.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="370" height="200" />
            <br/> will create this, <br/>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 011251.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="320" height="200" />
        </ui>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>React will break down the Javascript given to browser readable code.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>notice that we have a <span class="blue">Div</span> surrounding the html. That is because technically
    .render can only render 1 element, so to add multiple they must be added in a single div.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.2 : Javascript expressions in JSX & ES6 Template Literals </h2>
    <br/>

    <p> JSX lets us put HTML in Javascript and even Javascript inside that HMTL.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Say I wanted to add a <span class="blue">const</span> into my HTML, we could simply 
    wrap the javaScript in {} to add it <br/>
    Ex :</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 013850.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="380" height="200" />
    <p>Outputs, </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 013942.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="200" />
    
    <p><br/> We can create any javascript expression within these currly braces {} 
        but not statements (ex: if(name==){} else{}) will not work.</p>
    

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.3,4 : JSX Attributes & Styling React Elements + Inline Styling for React Elements</h2>
    
    <p>Adding CSS styling.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>We can ethier link them in our html, but a better way is to import them from within our JSX file 
        so that we have greater flexibility with what is used. <br/>
        ex :
    </p>

    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 021143.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="200" />

    <p>Will give </p>

    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 021235.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="100" />
    <p>Since we have ./index.css imported into the JSX file.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Note attributes we add for our HTML will now we done camel cased for JSX ex: classname is now className, etc.
        use w3schools to learn more on HTML attributes.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>We can even just the javaScript embeding to set const and image names then {} to input them in img src="" lines.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>If we want an inline style added, instesd of ex: (style="color: red") we write : (style={{color: "red"}}), in JSX it wants the style as a JS object (key : value).
        first pair of {} is for javaScript to go in second set is for the key value pair object.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Inline styles are great if we want to use the const to rapidly change styles based on certain changes, by making classes that are 
        just key value pairs, from within the JSX file, ex : 
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 024551.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="250" height="100" />
    <p>Is a JSX javascript style class that can be used in style={}. We can then edit this as well constantly
        and even by using if statements.<br/> So,
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 025854.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="400" />
    <p>Gives output of cool night and blue text or hot day and red text depending on the current hour</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 030314.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="400" />
    <p>(blue text in the AM hours)</p>


    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.5 : React components </h2>
    
    <p>Creating component functions that return html, basically creating custom elements to make coding smaller.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>So adding this function (CavsText) and then adding it in as a called element will</p> 
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 183043.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="400" />
    <p>output,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 183350.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="400" />

    <p><br/> To clear up clutter further we can just move this function to a helper JSX file and import it,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 185941.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="440" />

    <p><br/> component files con only have 1 function exportable in them per file. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>npm install, then npm start to run dev jsx files gotten from the site on VS</p>


    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.6 : Import, Export and Modules </h2>


    <p>You already know how importing and exporting files work</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To export multiple functions from Helper, in addition to the default export we write 
        export {} where inside is all the non default exports. <br/>
        To get those items we do <span class="blue">import Nam, {ext1, ext2} from "./file.jsx"</span> to get the 
        extra helpers, names of the extras must be extact to what we want. just do {ext1()} to use it. <br/> Or
        we could just do <span class="blue">import * as Nam from "./file.jsx"</span> to import everything into a object Nam. 
    </p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.7 : React properties</h2>

    <p>How to send items to the functions </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Ethier just put them into the function like a regular Java function 
       if we are calling an extra export function, <span class="blue">{CurrentInfo(player, "Los Angeles")}</span> <br/>
       If we are using the default function then need to do <span class="blue">(Header var=""/)</span></p>, as 
       well the default function will take in its items from a single object rather than multiple different variables.
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 211618.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="340" />
    <p>This regular and default function is used in the App like, </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 205754.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="240" />
    
    <p><br/> this gives, </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 211700.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="540" />

    <p><br/>So we have now made repeatable inputable HTML.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.7 : React DevTools</h2>

    <p>Tools to help see where items come from (Using React Developer Tools installed onto chrome).
        Use these devtools when debugging.
    </p>
    <br/>


    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.8 : Mapping data to components</h2>

    <p>Learning how to loop the JSX default functions to build easier
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p><span class="blue">list.map(function)</span> .map is a function which will loop over every element in "list" and run 
    the function "function" on each.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Using this looping, we can turn this section of code </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 222012.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="330" height="110" />
    <p>Into this, as long as we set up the list for it to run on, and each item given as a unique ID under "key" (key does not count as a prop, dev tools will show this). 
    These both give the same output. We could also jsut diectly add Helper to map if "id" was instead "key"</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 223253.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="290" />

    <p><br/> For non default functions I think you can just run a loop on it with a list, like in java, but that doesnt look clean.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.9 : Map/Filter/Reduce</h2>

    <p>Going to go through the <span class="blue">.map(function)</span> function in greater detail and look at some of the 
    related functions that help deal with arrays such as <bt/>
    .map <br/> .filter <br/> .reduce <br/> .find <br/> .findIndex</p>
    <br/>

    <p> output = <span class="blue">array.map(func)</span> -Create a new array (if we choose to capture the output) by doing something with each item in an array (using the func given)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>output = <span class="blue">array.filter(func)</span> -Create a new array by keeping items that return true (everytime the func returns true, the index that got the boolean true return 
        is added to the output)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>output = <span class="blue">array.reduce(func)</span> -Accumulate a value by doing something to each item in an array (sum up / combine the items in array given).<br/> 
    Function should include an variable for accumulation and current number (func(acum, curr)). reduce will make sure these varables are set correctly, 
    so long as the output from the func in the acumulated value.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>output = <span class="blue">array.find(func)</span>, finds first instance of an item in the array. Ex : (return num > 10) is 
    the func given, then output is the first value in the array where the value is greater than 10</p>
    <br/>

    <p>output = <span class="blue">array.findIndex(func)</span>, finds first instance of an item in the array and returns the index for it. Ex : (return num > 10) is 
        the func given, then output is the index of the first value in the array where the value is greater than 10</p>
    <br/>

    
    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.10 : ES6 Arrow Functions</h2>

    <p>Arrow functions/Fat functions are a shorter way of writing a javaScript function. (Next step from anonymous functions)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Ex: take the anonymous implimentation for a function map uses,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 180847.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="190" />
    <p>This can be made even smaller as an arrow function,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 181021.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="190" />
    <p>Could also get rid of the parenthesis around the x since its only 1 variable being used, as well is the code is only one 
        peice we can get rid of the return and curly brackets, to get inline code that looks like this. </p>
        <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 181639.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="430" height="130" />
    <p>Much shorter functions are now made, helpful for basic mapping and the like.</p>

    <br />

    <h2>36.11 : Conditional rendering with the Ternary Operator & AND Operator
    </h2>

    <p>Going to add a basic login that shows different React componnents based on some condition. 
        Basically how we add (if else/ or), plus and statements. Ex, 
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 190005.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="440" height="100" />
    <p>Uses a ternary operation to decide if to display the login function hmtl or the logged text (nested ternary is possible). Below 
        that it runs && to determine if the hour is below 12 add the text to the HTML.
    </p>

    <h2>36.11 : State in React - Declarative vs. Imperative Programming
    </h2>

    <p>How to create interactive React apps, to do this we need to understand State.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>State : Our UI is a function of the state, state changes brought about by the UI cause page changes </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Declartive programming uses variables (like booleans) to determine the state of an item</p>
    
    <p>Imperative doesnt use variables but instead directly changes the properties of the element </p>
    
    <br/>

    <p>Declarative uses need to be rerendered in order for the change in the Ex: style property, to be read and acted on. 
        this takes the use of React Hooks which lets us actively change these state variables for our app. <br/>
        Ex: The booleans here control the state
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 203945.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="200" />
    <p>This declarative implimentation would see no active changes since there are no hooks setup to actively change 
        "isDone" but this is how declarative would look.
    </p>


    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.11 : React Hooks - useState
    </h2>

    <p>Say we had the following buttons which called functions to increase and decrease the value of count.</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 205849.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="280" height="100" />
    <p>Regularly incrementing and decrementing the value of count would not change the displayed value. 
        To have changes be actively read and rendered we need to use useState, instead of writing a whole new .createRoot
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 210121.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="280" height="40" />
    <p><span class="blue">[count, setCount]</span> will map "count" to index 0 of setState, so it now represents the current value of state, and 
    "setCount" is mapped to index 1 of setState the function of the state. The 0 in useState() represents the inital value of the state.</p>
    <p>Can have useState() seperately like this or as React.useState, if we didnt import its function specifically as well.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>The function we setCount has the ability to actively update count/stateValue, so the following code would actively change the display value,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 211738.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="200" height="140" />
    <p>Any name can be chosen for the func same with the value variable, anything can be in the fun, as log
        as the output of it matches the setState value inital type.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Now we have an actively updating counter,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 212831.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="250" height="440" />
    <p>If I wanted say a dynamically updating clock, I would use <span class="blue">setInterval(func, time)</span> to 
    call a func that would update the value of the state of the clock to the newest time. Ex,</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-15 214924.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="300" height="160" />
    <p>1000 is in miliseconds.</p>

    <h2>36.12 : ES6 Object & Array Destructuring
    </h2>

    <p>This is just how to grab objects from complex arrays and Objects, you know how to do this.</p>
    <br/>

    <ui>
        <li>[item1, item2] = array : To take objects of the array (assume the main array only holds 2 objects)</li>
        <li> {item1, item2} = dict : To take values of key item1, item2 from a dict/Obj structure</li>
        <li>{item1: newName, item2: newName2} = dict : To change variable names from inital key names </li>
        <li>{item1="word", item2="word"} = dict : If item1/item2 is undefined use word instead  </li>
        <li>{item1, itemDict : {item1.1, item2.1}} = dict : To grab variables from a nested obj/dict</li>
    </ui>

    <p><br/>It's possible to return functions Ex, ( return [1, function() {something}]; )</p>

    <h2>36.13 : Event Handling in React
    </h2>

    <p>How to detect when a user interacts with your app or components, and how to use React to render 
        different things depending on those events.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Let's update our login button to change color if we hover over it, so we will change our LoggingDis 
        to accomidate for dynamic changes,
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-16 005428.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="490" />
    <p>LoggingDis was updated, it now includes dynamically changing variables that will update a boolean to 
        determine the color of the login box depending on if mouse is over it, it also sets text upon button click. 
        Changed from form to Div beacuse form would instant reset the headingText </p>

    <h2>36.13 : React Forms
    </h2>

    <p>How to handle events that arise from a things like a login form, like getting user input then using it</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Will need to add an onChange event on input elements, convert username input to non component version, else its return and build would 
        have to be much different
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-16 012858.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="580" height="690" />
    <p>With this, the username is actively displayed above, updated upon every login click, since we only updated the displaying useSate 
        upon click.</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-16 013430.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="280" height="70" />
    <p>Reason we use div for these interactive forms over form is that form will auto refresh the page using 
        onSubmit, need to sue onSubmit to go to a func with event then do even.preventDefault() to block the refresh. </p>

    <br />

    <h2>36.14 : Changing Complex State
    </h2>

    <p><br> First task is being able to put two dynamic string together for display, trivial.</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-16 015305.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="510" height="490" />
    <p>Just added another input and useState()</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To simplify this, we can combine the two useState objects into one, by setting the inital state to be an 
        object holding fName and lName,
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-16 021522.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="510" height="520" />
    <p>Now states have been combined into an object, prevValue gets the previous value of the useState. If we 
        dont update all at the same time, parts of the dict will be overwrote and lost. Also dont use event within a useState 
        set function, it will cause an error sometimes.

    <p>Used to instert an object into another object without nested the object.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Done with <span class="blue">...object</span> to indicate this object is being spread and added, instead of being 
    added/used and a single object.</p>

    <p>Using this we will move our login useStates to the login component to compartmentalize our code better.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>Along side that we moved our fullname display to a sperate componenet as well, this was just sending an element into props 
        to be read so that was simple.
    </p>
