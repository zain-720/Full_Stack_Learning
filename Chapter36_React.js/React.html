    <h1>Chapter : REACT</h1>
    <hr />


    <h2>36.0 : Intro </h2>
    <p>React learning files will be on (CodeSandbox) and (my-react-app once you learn how to use React better)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To make things easier, most work done will be complied in the my-react-app and built up to mordern standards to make
    understanding better.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>To set up React in VS : Going to be using vite to build our apps, so do <br/>
        npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react, then <br/>
        Select as React as the framework, then <br/>
        Select Javascript as the variant to work with, then <br/>
        cd my-react-app, to go to the app build, then <br/>
        npm install, install dependencies, then <br/>
        npm run dev, to run server <br/>
        Vite will recomplie the server everytime its updated to make coding easier.</p>

    <h2>36.1 : Intro to JSX and Babel </h2>
    <br/>

    Notes : 
    <p><br/>
        <ui>
            <li>A single div in our body section with the ID root will be in most any React app
                by convention, and is the root of our react application. So everything we create
                in React will be inserted inside div ID root. This will be all the HTML code needed as the 
                rest will be done in the java-script file using React. </li>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 002648.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="370" height="200" />
            <p><br/></p>

            <li>In index.js the first thing we do is require the react and react-dom modules.</li>
            <p><br/></p>

            <li>Next <span class="blue">ReactDOM.render is depreciated</span> so we here we will use ReactDOM.createRoot, which
                does the same thing. Now we create a const "root" which has where we want to show the code, 
                while render() still holds what to show. So this, </li>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 011032.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="370" height="200" />
            <br/> will create this, <br/>
            <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 011251.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="320" height="200" />
        </ui>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>React will break down the Javascript given to browser readable code.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>notice that we have a <span class="blue">Div</span> surrounding the html. That is because technically
    .render can only render 1 element, so to add multiple they must be added in a single div.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>36.2 : Javascript expressions in JSX & ES6 Template Literals </h2>
    <br/>

    <p> JSX lets us put HTML in Javascript and even Javascript inside that HMTL.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Say I wanted to add a <span class="blue">const</span> into my HTML, we could simply 
    wrap the javaScript in {} to add it <br/>
    Ex :</p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 013850.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="380" height="200" />
    <p>Outputs, </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 013942.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="200" />
    
    <p><br/> We can create any javascript expression within these currly braces {} 
        but not statements (ex: if(name==){} else{}) will not work.</p>
    

    <br />

    <h2>36.3,4 : JSX Attributes & Styling React Elements + Inline Styling for React Elements</h2>
    
    <p>Adding CSS styling.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>We can ethier link them in our html, but a better way is to import them from within our JSX file 
        so that we have greater flexibility with what is used. <br/>
        ex :
    </p>

    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 021143.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="200" />

    <p>Will give </p>

    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 021235.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="390" height="100" />
    <p>Since we have ./index.css imported into the JSX file.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Note attributes we add for our HTML will now we done camel cased for JSX ex: classname is now className, etc.
        use w3schools to learn more on HTML attributes.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>We can even just the javaScript embeding to set const and image names then {} to input them in img src="" lines.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>If we want an inline style added, instesd of ex: (style="color: red") we write : (style={{color: "red"}}), in JSX it wants the style as a JS object (key : value).
        first pair of {} is for javaScript to go in second set is for the key value pair object.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>Inline styles are great if we want to use the const to rapidly change styles based on certain changes, by making classes that are 
        just key value pairs, from within the JSX file, ex : 
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 024551.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="250" height="100" />
    <p>Is a JSX javascript style class that can be used in style={}. We can then edit this as well constantly
        and even by using if statements.<br/> So,
    </p>
    <img src="./images/Screenshot 2024-11-14 025854.png" alt="Cool Photo" width="450" height="400" />
    <p>Gives output of cool night and blue text or hot day and red text depending on the current hour</p>
