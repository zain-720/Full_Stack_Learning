    <h1>Chapter 11: Bootstrap </h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>11.0 Bootstrap Intro</h2>

    <p>External layout systems: premade CSS that helps in laying out a webpage.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Cant learn more about its componenets below and on the Bootstrap website</p>

    <br />

    <h2>11.1 Bootstrap layout</h2>

    <p>Understanding the 12 column Bootstrap layout system:</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Made of 3 components, a div with class container, inside that another div with class row, <br/>
    and inside the row is where we have our items which will be laid out using the column system.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>This is showcased in the example below.</p>
    <br/>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col background">Hello</div>
            <div class="col background">Hi</div>
            <div class="col background">Something</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br/>

    <p>The "container" is automatically setup, different kinds of containers exist in bootstrap for different size displays.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>"col" is also modifiable, with col-2, col-4 representing taking up 2 and 4 columns worth of space out of a total of 12 column spaces dividing the space.<br/>
         Base col with try to equally take up whatever space is left </p>
    <br/>

    <p>In this: <br/>
         "Hello" is col-md-4 col-sm-2, so takes up 4 col at medium size and 2 at small,<br/>
         "Hi" is col-md-6 col-sm-3 <br/>
         "Something" is col-md col-sm</p>
    <br/>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-2 background" >Hello</div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-3 background">Hi</div>
            <div class="col-md col-sm background">Something</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br/>

    <p>We also have breakpoints like sm, md etc which go in as col-sm-"wtv else" which set a break to the size of the column, helps for optimizing for specific devices <br/>
    With this in mind its possible to input multiple breakpoints so it has an option for each size of device the screen is set to</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>11.2 Bootstrap components</h2>

    <p>Learn to use the pre-built and pre-styled Components: (Again you can also just look at the website)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Buttons : Below is a bootstrap given buttons</p>
    <br/>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-link"><a href="../HTML_Portfolio_Page_Extras/Full_Stack_Index.html">Return To Index Link</a></button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
    <br/><br/>

    <p>Many different kinds of button implimentations available</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Navs: Bootstrap comes with a prebuilt navbar on its website</p>
    <br/>

    <p>The rest of this section jsut talks about available items on Bootstrap, no need to document them here, just open the Bootstrap website to read them.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Some of these implimentations may also need javaScript code to give some features functionality, for the Bootstrap components just copt the script link <br/>
    on the website and paste it at the bottom next to the body tag</p>

    <br />
