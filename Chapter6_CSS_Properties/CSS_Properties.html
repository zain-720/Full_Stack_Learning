    <p> Just a recap of previous color talk from chapter 5, and custom color hex code creation. </p>

    <h2>6.1 Font Properties</h2>

    Example : <br />
    <br />
    h2 { <br />
    <ul>
        font-weight: bold <br />
        font-size: 25px <br />
        font-family: sans-serif <br />
        text-algin: center <br />
    </ul>    
    }
    <br />
    <br />

    Font size logic

    <ul>
        <li> px: pixel </li>
        <li> pt: similar to pixel </li>
        <li> em: 100% size of parent  </li>
        <li> rem: 100% size of root  </li>
    </ul>

    What does (em) and (rem) do exactly? <br />
    <br />
    Ex : (em) <br />

    Lets say {h1: 1rem}, then if we had a parent tag on it h1 would take 100% the size of the parent tag <br />
    <br />
    &lt;body&gt;
    <ul>
        &lt;h1&gt; Lebron James &lt;/h1&gt; </li>
    </ul>
    &lt;/body&gt;
    <br /> <br />
    <p>If body was 20px then h1 in this case would be 20px. If h1 was 2em and body 20px then we get (20 * 2) = 40px
        as h1 size in this case
    </p>

    <br />
    Ex : (rem) <br />

    <p>Looking back to our previous case where body is 20px but now {h1: 2rem}, h1 is not affected by body
        anymore only the highest level (root) tag can ffect it, in most cases that is just the html tag. <br /> <br />
        Try to use this as a base for creating text sizes for your site 
    </p>

    <br />
    Font weight. (lighter, bolder) are relative to parent font weight while we can normally use (normal, bold)
    <br /><br />

    <p>Font familes. Simply the type of font we want to use with backups if it fails to work. Can also
        import fonts from outside sources using &lt;link&gt;.
    </p>

    <h2>6.2 Inspecting CSS</h2>

    <p>Tools to help with debugging our css. On chrome when on an hmtl just (more tools), then (developer tools)
        and it will open up, or just clicking (insepct) on an item to see its location in the html including its
        css style addons and other css abrtibutes. Any changes made here does not acctually affect the real file.
        <br /> <br />

        Going to more tools in developer tools the nclicking (CSS Overview) we can get a break out of the fonts
        colors and other elements used to make the site easier. 
    </p>

    <h2>6.3 CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding and Border properties</h2>
    <br />

    Allow elements to take up more or less space, depending on how we set it up. <br /><br />

    Ex : for some element <br />
    height: 300px, 100% (of page size) <br />
    width: 300px, 100% (of page size) <br /> <br />


    This below makes a style=(solid) color=(balck) type=(border) thickness=(10px) thick around the box.
    Given (border: 10px solid black) we can do. <br /> <br /> 

    &emsp;border-top: 0px  (no more boarder at top)<br />
    &emsp;border-width: 0px, 10px, 20px, 30px  (0 top, 10 right, 20 bottom, 30 left)<br />
    &emsp;border-width: 0px, 10px (0 top, 10 right, 0 bottom, 10 left)<br /> <br />

    So we can have further specifications for box perameters, as well as padding around text. <br /> <br />

    &emsp; padding: 20px (text inside now surrounded by at least 20 more px on all sides to push boarder out) <br /> <br />

    margin will create a buffer between boarders. <br /> <br />

    &emsp; margin: 10px (10px buffer outside of the border) <br /> <br />

    This picture sums it all up. <br /> 

    <img src="./Screenshot 2024-10-25 143638.png" alt="box layout picture"/> <br /> <br />

    <p>The tag &lt;div id=""&gt; &lt;/div&gt; allows us to set up our own boxes from a group of elements and not just singular ones.
        For example take this box below connects to id="box-1" for this image and text, so everything in it is one box a
        affected by its rules.
    </p>

    <div id="box-1">

        div set with 200px height 200px width <br /> <br />

        Gold background <br />
        Purple text <br />
        2px side border, 4px top and bottom border <br />
        padding of 10px from border <br />
        base margin of 20px from other boxes and website walls <br />
        added margin-left 150px <br />

    </div>

    Note : items like the paragraph element get 1px margin automatically, make sure to offeset this to keep everything center.
