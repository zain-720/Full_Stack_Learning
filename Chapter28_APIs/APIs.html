    <h2>28.0 Into to APIs</h2>

    <br/>
    <p>API's give data in a certain format for you to use or will take in data in a certain format. These formats
        are specified by the API (recall 207 for all of this)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>In this course we will be learning API usage off of (REST:API) style of APIs. Rest API's use the 
        HTTP protocals to interact with it.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>For thiss lesson we will be working with the API off of postman "https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer"
        is what we used to learn. Send a get request to the given reasource URL after reading through docummentation
        and you will get back the data you want. EX : https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544"" via a GET request brings back data on the ISS
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Postman also has API's we can use later for applications you want to make.</p>

    <h2>28.1 Structuring API Requests</h2>

    <p>Endpoints, path parameters and Query Parameters, how to format and change API requests, 
        how to use public APIs. We will be using this API for this lesson "http://bored-api.appbrewery.com".
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>API Endpoints : normally for requests we have "BaseURL/Endpoint" this Endpoint can be for different purposes.
        for example in the API system in the bored it could be "/random", "/filter", its jsut a different route to different functions of the API.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Query Parameters : After our endpoint we can add a query parameter ex "BaseURL/Endpoint?query=value". 
       (This is just a key value pair) This is a way to put a key value pair into the URL when you prodvide extra 
       information for a request. Can even have multiple ex "BaseURL/Endpoint?query=value&query2=value". Here is 
       an example of this as a GET request to the bored api "https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/filter?type=education(or social, etc)".
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Path Parameters : Added at the very end ex BaseURL/endpoint/{path-parameter}. Some very specific to identify a reasource 
        in the API, unike query parameters where it could be multiple things path parameters are for getting specifics. For example
        this is something used on a GET request from the bored api "https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/activity/3943506". In this case we give it a key 
        for a specific activity from /activity
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>28.2 What is JSON</h2>

    <p> <br/>What is a JSON : A JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, a way to format data. Similar to
    Javascript but the JSON is serialized into a String (look at recipe.json) the key value pairs have both key and value
    as Strings. </p>
    <br/>

    <p>EX : const wardrobe = {doors: 2, drawers: 2}; becomes just {"doors": 2, "drawers": 2} in JSON format <br/>
    Can use "jsonveiwer.stack.hu" to read these flat JSON packs better</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Turning a JS object into a JSON : This is done when we want to send some info over the internet. Can do this using a 
        method from the JSON module and then writing something like this on your key value holder "const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data)"
        <br/> To unpack data from a JSON back into a JS object this is done using another part of the JSON module "const data = JSON.parse(jsonData)" <br/>
        All of this can be found in folder 5.2
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>28.3 Server-side API Requests</h2>

    <p>Making server side API requests using Axios</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Axios is a node module that makes making requests to an API from a server alot more simple
        than it usually would be if we made them without it (seen in folder 5.3). IIt auto turns "response"
        variable into a JS data format, has an (await) function that waits for response before continuing
        and it makes getting the data take many lines fewer to do (dont need to compile the response data into correct format)
    </p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <h2>28.4 API Authentication</h2>

    <p>Authenticating yourself with the API provider, proving you have the rights to access an API, (like in 207)</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Recall the types of authentication. </p>

    <ui>
        <li>No Authentication</li>
        <li>Basic Authentication</li>
        <li>API Key Authorisation</li>
        <li>Token Bosed Authentication</li>
    </ui>
    

    <p><br/> No Authentication : Pulic APIs usally just have a rate limit to stop spam usage of it for each IP address asking for it </p>
    <br/>

    <p> Basic Authentication : Provide a username and password when you make a request to the API.
        This is usally a base64 encoded string added into the Header when we make a request, we can test this with postman
        on the "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com" API.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>So for example for this API we first need to input send POST request on "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/register" with key value pairs for 
        username: and password:, to register ourselves for the API. <br/>
        Now later when we run the GET request "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/all?page=1" we input the username and password we registered in Base64 in the header in format "username:password" we get back the data asked for. <br/>
        Though something like Axios will just do this for us if we provide it the username and password.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>API Key Authorisation : Authorisation is something that allows us to use an API while Authentication is something
        that allows someone to be identified as a user to the API provider. Again we can use "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com"
        to test key authorisation to allow for certain endpoint useage.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>First there is a GET call "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/generate-api-key" to send us a key for the API. <br/>
       Next we can use the key to run a GET request on the endpoint /filter "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/filter?score=5&apiKey=b886c845-9989-43aa-8c60-ea4a669bb587",
       filtering by score 5,  next providing the apiKey to be allowed to make this request. (sometimes api-key goes in the header other times the query). </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Token Based Authentication : We get the user to user a username and password to login and then once they've logged in we generate a token 
        to be used with the API, so the API is not involved with the username and password, instead it works with a token generated. <br/>
        For example when we sign into google it generates a token which lets other apps access google API networks, so we could for example interact with google 
        calander that as user without ever taking the users username or password. 
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>So for example again in "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com" there is "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/secrets/{}" to GET secrets for a specific ID {}. 
        This is protected by bearer token protection, which uses a users username and password to get a token which will then be used as a rpoxy to interact with the API.
        So if we POST a request to "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/get-auth-token" with a body of key values pairs for username: and password:,
        we get back a token for that specific user. <br/>
        Now to run "https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/secrets/2" and we add in the token we got where the API specifies (with the help of Axios, or just put in the header in this case),
        after this we get the return from the API as wanted.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>To use this in code : Input the Tokens, Keys and usernames and passwords wherever they need to be.
        <br/>For basic authentication with Axios, we send location we look to get from an a key value pair holder "auth". 
        <br/>For Key authorisation with Axios, in this case we send the GET request a location we look to get from, and a key value pair holder with query parameters, including the apiKey, in the order the API asks
        <br/>For token based authorisation with Axious, we add the Bearer token to the headers and send that with the location we look to get from 
        <br/>All of these are available to look at from the 5.4 Folder Solution.js which makes these calls.   </p>

    <p>Docummentation on how to use the rest of the REST API requests and items that can be added to 
        config can be found of the Axious website "https://axios-http.com/docs/intro"

    <p>Folder 5.4 solution.js has implimentation of each type of request.</p>
