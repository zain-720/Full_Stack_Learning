    <h1>Chapter 23: Node.js </h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>23.0 What is Node.js</h2>

    <p><br/>Node.js is a Java based backend framework, framworks are filled with prebuilt components that make
    back end much simplier than writing without it on the regular language.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Node lets run javascript on our own local computer rather than leaving it locked to the webpage.
        its asynchronous event-driven. Node.js lets us run stuff on a server (computer). It basically lets us
        write javascript for a backend as well.
    </p>

    <h2>23.1 Using Node</h2>

    <p><br/> Node REPL : <br/>
    Read: <br/>
    Eval: <br/>
    Print: <br/>
    Loop; <br/>
    Enviroment where user inputs are read and evaluated and then results and returned to the user.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Type "node" in terminal to start up node, we are now in the node REPL</p>
    <br/>
    <p>.(.help) for help (.exit or Ctrl+C) to exit.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>We can write anything that is javaScript in the node REPL and it will run.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Can run javaScript files with node using (node name.js) in terminal (tab can autofill names)</p>

    <h2>23.2 How to Use Native Node Modules</h2>

    <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/index.html">Node.js documentation</a>

    <p><br/>Node.js is a tool set that make creatin gapplications server side alot easier. Icluding file access, networking and alot more.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>filesystem module : first we need to request this node module. (everything here done in folder 23.2)</p>
    <br/>
    <p>const fs = require("fs");</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Now to use a method in this module we just got : fs.writeFile(file, data[, options], callback); ,
        we are going to use this to write into a fresh new file in folder 23.2 with data of a string.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Run the node.js from the terminal, now we've just used a native node module.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Next reading from the file using fs.readFile(filepath,dataFormat,(err or data));(in 23.3 .js file)</p>

    <h2>23.3 Node Package Manager NPM</h2>

    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Where to find npm packages</a>

    <p><br/> The NPM is a place which collects modules people have made for Node.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Work with npm in 23.3 folder index.js</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Initialize first NPM project:</p>
    <br/>
    
    <ol>
        <li>At wanted location in terminal write : npm init</li>
        <li>Answer the given questions (leave some blank for now, or put -y at the end of init to skip this, or just npm i)</li>
        <li>Once all of this is done a new file called package.json is created</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now we can import npm packages to our .js file</p>
    <br/>

    <p>In the terminal where npm was initialized we can do (npm i sillyname) to add packages to use.
        Once ran a new dependency is added to our package.json. It also created a folder called node_modules
        which is filled with the codes for package (sillyname)
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Reading the documentation for the added package will tell us how to use it. We use the new package
        in the index.js in folder 23.3
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Can also just import keyword instead to bring in the npm and node packages (as seen in index.js).
        However to allow this to be used with node we need to go into the package.json and add a feild tpye:
        and set it to "moudle"  </p>
