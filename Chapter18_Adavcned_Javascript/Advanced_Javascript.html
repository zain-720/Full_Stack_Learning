    <h1>Chapter 18: Advanced javascript and DOM manipulation </h1>
    Adding event listeners, sound, and animations to your HTML (working from a project file given)
    <hr />

    <h2>18.0 Overview</h2>
    <p> In Drum_Project, Drum Project Starter has the files we will be working on to impliment everything to be learned
        this chapter
    </p>

    <h2>18.1 Adding Event Listeners to a Button</h2>

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">Types of events page</a>
    
    <p><br/> First make a function that does something when the button gets clicked :</p>
    <p>Next and event listener that listens for button click, to do this : <br/><br/>

    Target item of intrest : document.querySelector("button") <br/><br/>

    Add event listener : document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", FuncToCall) <br/>
    FuncToCall could also jsut be a anonymous function where the whole function without a name is just placed there isntead. <br/><br/>
    
    Add multiple evemt listenters : if we want multiple event listetners for a element, class, ID, etc, we can loop
    on on .querySelectorAll("") and add listeners for each of the items.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>This can all be seen on the index.js in the project code</p>

    <br />

    <h2>18.2 Passing Functions as Arguments</h2>

    <p>Its possibel to pass a function name into a function as an argument then use it later to call said function. <br/>
    function bob(opp, num1, num2) { return opp(num1, num2) } , This is a possible function in javascript. <br/>
    These functions that take other functions as inputs are called "Higher Order Functions"</p>

    <h2>18.3 How to play sound on a website</h2>

    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9419263/how-to-play-audio">How to play audio page</a>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement">More about audio</a>

    <p><br/> var audio = new Audio('audio_file_name/path'); <br/>
    audio.play();<br/><br/>

    This code will store and play the audio file given to it. Can also be seen on the project file (index.js).
    Alot more functions available for this audio, can be found in second link.</p>
    <br/>

    <p>In js to get the current item which the action listener fired for, we can just add a "this". We can use
       this to get info on the button that made the press, like for example the innerHTML/textContext.
       More seen in project code (as well a switch statement to help it)
    </p>
    <br/><br/>

    <p><h4>Extras:</h4>
    To set image from CSS for a background do : background-image url("location"); in whatever you want to have that
    style change. <br/><br/>
    Can make objects very simply ex : var bob = {age: 12, height: "short", hasJob: true} <br/>
    Contructors also work as they do in Java var bob = new Bob(Info, ToSend, ToFunc, ConstructorBob);</p>
    <br/>
    Method : function associated with an object ex : bob.getMoney() , .getMoney(); is a method of bob
    <p></p>

    <h2>18.4 Keyboard events</h2>
    <p>Note : use (keydown) insstead od (keypress)</p><br/>

    <p>To do this for our event listener istead of having it listen to "click" we have it listen for "keydown".
    </p> <br/>

    <p> In function parameters we can pass in "event" which lets us looking into the even that triggered the listener.
        using this we can create certain switch cases for certain keys when they are the event. Get the key with event.key, 
        there are other stuff you can do with it, just look those up online if you need them.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>This all can be seen on project code index.js</p>
    <br/>

    <br />

    <h2>18.5 adding animations to websites</h2>

    <p>Lets make the buttons that are on the project flash when pressed (ethier click or keyboard). This addition can 
        be found in the project code as well as a new function buttonAnimation(currentKey){}
    </p>
