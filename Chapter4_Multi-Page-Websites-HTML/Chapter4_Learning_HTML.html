<h2>Computer File Paths 4.0</h2>
<br />


<p>Just explains how to write file paths (you should know this if your at least done year 1 CS) <br />
(..) means to go up a level from current directory and go to file within the upper level <br />
(.) means within current directory </p>

Example:

<p>&nbsp; &lt;img src="./4_0_FilePaths/Folder0/rabbit.png" alt="rabbit" /&gt; </p>

Should produce <br />

<img src="./4_0_FilePaths/Folder0/rabbit.png" alt="rabbit" />

<br />By following the file path given to it

<h2>What are Webpages? 4.1</h2>

<p>Link together HTML files using filepaths and hyper links. Below i will connect this<br />
HTML page to the HTML page within (4_1_WebPages) using a photo also within folders, as well as a link to contact page in folder.</p> 

So :

<p>&nbsp; &lt;a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/about.html"&gt;&lt;img src="./4_1_WebPages/assets/images/cat.png" alt="cat" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <br /><br />
   &nbsp; &lt;a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/contact.html"&gt;Contact page&lt;/a&gt;</p>

Gives : <br />

<a href ="./4_1_WebPages/public/about.html"><img src="./4_1_WebPages/assets/images/cat.png" alt="cat" /></a>
<br />

<a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/contact.html">Contact page</a>
<br />
<br />

Picture links to an about page, text links to a cantact page, both HTML files are in 4_1 folder.
