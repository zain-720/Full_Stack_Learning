<h2>Computer File Paths 4.0</h2>
<br />


<p>Just explains how to write file paths (you should know this if your at least done year 1 CS) <br />
(..) means to go up a level from current directory and go to file within the upper level <br />
(.) means within current directory </p>

Example:

<p>&nbsp; &lt;img src="./4_0_FilePaths/Folder0/rabbit.png" alt="rabbit" /&gt; </p>

Should produce <br />

<img src="./4_0_FilePaths/Folder0/rabbit.png" alt="rabbit" />

<br />By following the file path given to it

<h2>What are Webpages? 4.1</h2>

<p>Link together HTML files using filepaths and hyper links. Below i will connect this<br />
HTML page to the HTML page within (4_1_WebPages) using a photo also within folders, as well as a link to contact page in folder.</p> 

So :

<p>&nbsp; &lt;a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/about.html"&gt;&lt;img src="./4_1_WebPages/assets/images/cat.png" alt="cat" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; <br /><br />
   &nbsp; &lt;a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/contact.html"&gt;Contact page&lt;/a&gt;</p>

Gives : <br />

<a href ="./4_1_WebPages/public/about.html"><img src="./4_1_WebPages/assets/images/cat.png" alt="cat" /></a>
<br />

<a href="./4_1_WebPages/public/contact.html">Contact page</a>
<br />
<br />

Picture links to an about page, text links to a cantact page, both HTML files are in 4_1 folder.

<h2>The HTML Boilerplate 4.2</h2>

Gives us the structure to HTML file. <br />

<img src="./4_2_HTML_Boilerplate/Screenshot 2024-06-03 170931.png" alt="HTML Boilerplate" />
<br />

<ul>
    <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; : Tells the cumpter what version of html this file was made on</li>
    <li>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;####&lt;/html&gt; : everything is writen within this (lang) tells us what language of text content</li>
    <li>&lt;head&gt;####&lt;/head&gt; : Area where important info about the website is placed, that will not be displayed to user</li>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; : character set encoding of page (this is a comman character set) other metas exsit, like view size stuff </li>
        <li>&lt;title&gt;####&lt;/title&gt; : Title of the page (displayed on tab bar)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>&lt;body&gt;#####&lt;/body&gt; : Main body for the HTML file</li> 
</ul>

<br />

You can just reuse the same basic boilderplate over and overagain if you want with diff titles. <br />
On VScode just do ! on first line and hit enter to insert boiler plate for html file
